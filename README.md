# Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that serves as an end-to-end example of a data science and machine learning proof of concept for heart disease classification.

## Problem Definition
The goal is to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical parameters.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Cleveland database from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease)
 but has been downloaded in a formatted way from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiyatasmeem/heart-disease-classification-dataset). It contains 14 attributes that will be used for prediction.

## Evaluation
The initial evaluation metric is set to achieve 95% accuracy in predicting heart disease during the proof of concept.

## Features
The features used for prediction include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, and thalium stress result.

## Tools and Libraries
The following libraries are utilized for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning tasks:
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Project Status
This project is still under development and will be updated regularly. Stay tuned for further updates and improvements.
